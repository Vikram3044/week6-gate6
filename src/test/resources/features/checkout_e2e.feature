Feature: Checkout places an order and the backend agrees
  Scenario: A logged-in customer checks out a two-item cart
    Given "alice" signs into the web shop
    And "alice" is logged in
    And she adds 2 x "SKU-BAG" (49900 paise each) through the UI
    When she checks out with a valid address
    Then the order confirmation shows status "PLACED"
    And GET /api/orders/{that id} returns PLACED and totalPaise 99800
    And the orders table has exactly one PLACED row for alice
